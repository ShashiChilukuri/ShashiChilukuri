[Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Image%20Classification/CSE%20575%20Porfolio%20Report.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Image%20Classification)
- **Activity Recognition:** Predicting the user activity using machine learning models. [Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Activity%20Recognition/ASU%20CSE%20572%20Data%20Mining%20-%20Porfolio%20Report.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Activity%20Recognition) 
- **Facial Keypoint Detection:** Used image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image to
find facial keypoints. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/CV(PyTorch)%20-%20Facial%20Keypoint%20detection)
- **Automatic Image Captioning:** Built complex deep learning model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input
image into a set of features and an RNN that turns those features into descriptive language. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/CV(PyTorch)%20-%20Image%20Captioning)
- **Landmark detection and tracking:** Implemented a robust method for tracking an object over time, using elements of
probability, motion models & linear algebra. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/CV(PyTorch)%20-%20Landmark%20detection%20and%20tracking)
- **Predict daily bike rental ridership:** Built neural network using gradient descent, back-propagation from scratch. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/ANN(MLP)%20-%20Predict%20daily%20bike%20rental%20ridership)
- **Classify Images:** Created Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implement a multi-class dog breed classifier using
Pytorch. Also used OpenCV based Harr Feature classifiers to detect human faces to detect breed type. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/CNN(PyTorch)%20-%20Dog%20Idenfificaiton%20App)
- **Generate new scripts:** Built a recurrent neural network using PyTorch to process provided 9 seasons of Seinfild TV
scripts and then used it to generate completely new episodes of Seinfeld. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/RNN(PyTorch)%20-%20TV%20Script%20Generation)
- **Generate human Faces:** Built a pair of Multi-Layer Neural Networks and made them compete against each other in order
to generate realistic faces, using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/DCGAN(PyTorch)%20-%20Generate%20Face)
- **Deploying Sentiment Analysis in the cloud:** Created a 'Sentiment Analysis Model' in PyTorch to classify a whether a
movie review is positive or negative. For this used AWS services - Amazon SageMaker, S3, Lambda function, EC2. [Code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Deploying%20a%20model)
