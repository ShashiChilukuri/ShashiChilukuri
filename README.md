### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shashi Kiran Chilukuri, a data scientist with passion for artificial intelligence and solving real-world business problems with it. Experience in implementing machine learning models, leading lean team, developing new products and providing valuable data insights. 

Here are some of the projects that I recently worked: 
â–ª **Develop marketing Profiles:** Developed marketing profiles and classified income using exploratory data analysis and predictive models with 85.4% accuracy. [Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Create%20marketing%20Profiles/Portfolio%20Report.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Create%20marketing%20Profiles)
â–ª **Geo-Spatial Analysis:** Performed Geo-Spatial analysis on big data using Spark SQL and Scala and identified 50 most significant hot spots. [Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Geo-Spatial%20Analysis/Geo-Spatial_Analysis_paper.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Geo-Spatial%20Analysis)
â–ª **Image classification:** Classifying images of handwritten digits using Density Estimation & NaÃ¯ve Bayes from scratch with 91.5% accuracy. [Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Image%20Classification/CSE%20575%20Porfolio%20Report.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Image%20Classification)
â–ª **Activity Recognition:** Predicting the user activity using machine learning models. [Project paper](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/blob/master/Activity%20Recognition/ASU%20CSE%20572%20Data%20Mining%20-%20Porfolio%20Report.pdf) and [code link](https://github.com/ShashiChilukuri/MCS-Projects/tree/master/Activity%20Recognition)
